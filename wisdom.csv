"The wisdom of crowds works when the crowd is choosing the price of an ox, when there's a single numeric average.

It isn't right to judge strength as better than good wisdom.,Xenophanes

"I'm not an academic philosopher, and don't agree with the way the universities approach the subject.

"When I rather guiltily read the books on which the TV series 'Game Of Thrones' is based, I was struck by one thing. The whole point of this saga is that ruthlessness pays, that evil generally wins, that justice is non-existent, and utter cynicism the only wisdom. It is the Middle Ages without the saving grace of Christianity.",Peter Hitchens
"When you're around some of the greatest minds in boxing, and you don't take something from it, you're a fool. I would just sit and listen to Don King talk all day, and everyone would be like, 'He talks too much.' I would tell them, 'No, there's wisdom in these conversations.'",Eric B.

"My first spoken word poem, packed with all the wisdom of a 14-year-old, was about the injustice of being seen as unfeminine.

"There's something peculiar about writing fiction. It requires an interesting balance between seeing the world as a child and having the wisdom of a middle-aged person.

"Experience is knowledge; but knowledge, when it is sought only as a material resource, is not always a blessing. Experience is wisdom; but wisdom, with those who lack vision, is not always power. Experience is tolerance; but tolerance, when it is induced by apathy, is not in the least a virtue.",Ameen Rihani

"At 17 years old, STG took me under its wing and shared its resources and wisdom with me, even allowing me to take part in a show at the Edinburgh Festival. Without STG and the Ramshorn Theatre, I would not have found access to the world of drama that I later made my profession.",Peter Capaldi
